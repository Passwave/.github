# Passwave

Passwave builds modern infrastructure for digital access, enabling properties of any size to deliver secure, mobile-first credentials to the people who use their spaces every day. Our technology powers seamless access across hospitality, multifamily, corporate workplaces, and residential environments—without requiring rip-and-replace hardware.

We focus on three core pillars: secure credential issuance, universal interoperability with existing building systems, and a connectivity layer that works reliably in real-world network conditions.

Our platform brings together:

- Mobile credentials that work across Apple Wallet, Google Wallet, BLE, NFC, and PIN-based access  
- A secure outbound connectivity agent for bridging on-prem hardware to the cloud  
- APIs and SDKs that allow partners and property systems to integrate access quickly and consistently  
- A multi-region, fault-tolerant backend designed for stability, compliance, and operational scale  

Passwave is engineered with a security-first mindset: strong cryptography, isolated trust boundaries, mutual TLS, and hardened system architecture from core to edge.  

We believe that access should be simple, secure, and universally interoperable. Our mission is to help properties modernize access experiences for guests, residents, employees, and operators—while preserving control, privacy, and choice.
